# GitHub & Git Assignment

## In this video, I learned about Git & Github. How to use it. I learned about clone, add, commit, push, pull & so on.
Clone - Bring the Repository that hosted somewhere else like Github in the folder on your local machine.
Add - Track your files and changes in Git.
commit - Save your files in Git.
push - Upload git commits to a remote repo, like github.
pull - Download changes from remote repo to your loacl machine, the opposite of push.
